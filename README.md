# personal-site
A personal website created for my career in computer science.

Visit it at [https://enprogames.github.io/](https://enprogames.github.io/).

## Special Parts

Most parts of the website use flexbox in order to position elements the way I wanted. It also
allows elements to scale and move effectively on different screen sizes.

I also added javascript functions and event listeners to the submit button in the contact page.
The event listener for hovering over the submit button was implemented using JQuery.
