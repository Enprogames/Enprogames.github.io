# personal-site
A personal website created for my career in computer science.

Visit it at [https://ethanposner.com/](https://ethanposner.com/).

## Special Parts

- Most parts of the website use flexbox in order to position elements the way I wanted. It also
allows elements to scale and move effectively on different screen sizes.
- Javascript was used to make the header and footers the same across the site.
- I also added javascript functions and event listeners to the submit button in the contact page.
- The event listener for hovering over the submit button was implemented using JQuery.
