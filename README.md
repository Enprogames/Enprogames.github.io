# personal-site
A personal website created for my career in computer science.

Visit it at [https://enprogames.github.io/](https://enprogames.github.io/).

## Special Parts

Most parts of the website use flexbox in order to position elements the way I wanted. It also
allows elements to scale and move effectively on different screen sizes.
