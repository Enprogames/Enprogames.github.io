                    <img alt="sql-injection3.JPG" class="project-image" src="img/sql-injection3.JPG">
                </div>
                <div class="double-column-right-part">
                    <p>
                        A simple Django website, created in collaboration with Sebastien Van Den Brempt
                        (<a href="https://github.com/Sebastien-Van">github</a>), to demonstrate
                        how SQL injections work. It features user registration and logging in,
                        and stores documents for the users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make the site vulnerable to SQL injections, a custom user authentication
                        backend was added. At the time of writing, this authentication backend is the
                        background of this website. It works by executing the following SQL statement:
                    </p>
                    <p class="code python-code">
                        <span class="sql-code">
                        "<span class="clause">SELECT</span> 
                        <span class="clause">*</span> 
                            <span class="clause">FROM</span>
                                <span class="identifier">auth_user</span>
                            <span class="clause">WHERE</span>
                                <span class="identifier">username</span> = <span class="string">'%s'</span>
                                <span class="bool-operator">AND</span> <span class="identifier">password</span>=<span class="string">'%s'</span>"</span>
                                % (username, <span class="function">make_password</span>(password, salt=salt))
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If more than one user is found using the query, the first one is returned. This
                        means that to bypass the system's authentication and login as a user, named "Nick"
                        for example, they need only type "Nick' OR 1=='1" into the username box.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this project was to demonstrate how easy SQL injections are to exploit if a web developer
                        isn't careful. According to 
                        <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/learn/how-to-prevent-sql-injection-attacks/">wordfence.com</a>,
                        18% of website hacks involve the use of SQL injections. They are often used to
                        steal sensitive information, such as hashed passwords and credit card numbers.

                        A program used for displaying flashcards. Flashcards are a great way to study
                        and memorize large amounts of information. They allow the user to repeatedly
                        quiz themselves on topics in order to continually reinforce them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the GUI, the python TKinter library was used. Most of my GUI programs use
                        this library as it allows for the quick creation of detailed user interfaces.
                        At this time, to create flashcards users must create CSV files in the "data_files"
                        directory of this project. They can also integrate the program with notion, share
                        their notion databases with the integration, and access their flashcards this way.
                        More detailed instructions are in the README of this project's github repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the future, I aim to do away with the notion integration, as this an unintuitive
                        method of adding flashcard data to the program. I aim to create a create, read, edit,
                        delete, list (CRUDL) menu for the flashcards within the program itself.

                        displays the time, current class, whether it is break time, and a joke at the top.

                    A simple music player program written in python. It uses pygame mixer for playing
                    sound files, and TKinter for the user interface. It also uses a python library
                    called Mutagen for gathering metadata about song files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main challenge with this project has been to find a good library for playing
                    sound files. So far, as mentioned, I've been using pygame mixer, but this library
                    has some drawbacks. For one, I need to change the position of the song when the
                    slider is clicked, and I also need to display the current playback location of the
                    file. When I get this information from pygame mixer, however, it gives me the
                    total time the song has been playing instead of the current playback position.
                    For this reason, I am planning to either switch to another library in the future,
                    or work around these issues in various ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, I want to add more functionality, such as the ability to create
                    playlists and change the theme of the user interface. Although this project isn't
                    very ambitious, it has been very enjoyable to work on.
