                        On weekends, especially during the summer time, I enjoy going for hikes. Hiking for
                        hours can be a difficult task, but it's always worth it to see the beautiful, scenic
                        landscapes here in British Columbia.

                        During the summer of 2021, me and four other guys completed the West Coast Trail
                        hike. This is a famous hike on Vancouver Island where hikers trek for 75 km in
                        the forest and on the beach. It took my group and I seven days to complete.
                        It was definitely very interesting spending this long eating freeze dried meals
                        and sleeping in tents.

                        Although I enjoy being in civilization and having access to hot showers, I feel
                        that being in nature helps me to step back and gain a new perspective of the world.

                        I've been interested in the world of electronic circuits as far back
                        as I can remember, and although it's a very daunting hobby to get into,
                        it can be incredibly satisfying when you get something to work.

                        I've found that the easiest way to get electric circuits to do what you want
                        is to use a microcontroller, such as an arduino.
